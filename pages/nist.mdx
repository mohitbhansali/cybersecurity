# NIST Framework

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a set of guidelines and best practices for improving cybersecurity within an organization. It was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as a way to help organizations of all sizes and in all sectors better understand and manage their cybersecurity risks.

The CSF is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and can be customized to fit the specific needs and goals of an organization. It is organized around five core functions:

1. Identify: This function involves identifying and characterizing the assets, systems, networks, and users within an organization's environment.

2. Protect: This function involves implementing security controls and practices to secure the organization's assets, systems, networks, and users from cybersecurity threats.

3. Detect: This function involves using various tools and technologies to monitor for and detect potential security threats and incidents.

4. Respond: This function involves taking appropriate action in response to a cybersecurity event, such as initiating incident response procedures and communicating with relevant stakeholders.

5. Recover: This function involves restoring the organization's operations and systems after a cybersecurity event, and minimizing the impact of the event on the organization.

Overall, the goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is to help organizations better understand and manage their cybersecurity risks, and to improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity events.
