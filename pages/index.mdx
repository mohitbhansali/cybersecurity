# Introduction

Cybersecurity is the practice of keeping digital attacks, theft, and damage from happening to computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data. Malware, ransomware, phishing scams, and other types of malicious software that can disrupt or steal information from a device or network can be used in these attacks.

Cybersecurity is important because it helps protect against these kinds of threats and makes sure that sensitive information, like financial data or personal information, stays private and safe. People and businesses should use strong passwords, keep their software and security systems up to date, and be careful when they click on links or download files from the internet.

## What is Cybersecurity Framework?

A cybersecurity framework is a collection of rules, recommendations, and requirements for guaranteeing the safety of a computer system. It offers a methodical methodology for maintaining and safeguarding crucial infrastructure against online attacks. An organization can utilize a cybersecurity framework, which is a collection of rules, procedures, and controls, to protect its systems and data. It may be used to assist businesses in identifying their unique security requirements, choosing how to distribute resources according to priority, and gauging the success of their security measures.

Organizations can use a variety of cybersecurity frameworks, such as the **[ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)** standard, and the **[NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity)**.
