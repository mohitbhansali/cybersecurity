# Pentest

## Who is a penetration tester
A penetration tester is one who gets to satisfy the deep dark desire of watching the world burn at their hands, but in a legal manner, of course.

## Steps

+ Reconnaisance - Gather information and understand the target
+ Scanning - Supplement the above step with some technical prodding
+ Gaining access - Use the intelligence gathered to exploit a certain behaviour
+ Maintaining access - Create a backdoor 
+ Clean up - Remove evidence of exploitation

It might be easier to deal with an example far more... tangible.
Assume the role of a thief. A thoughtful one at that.

+ Reconnaisance - Is anyone home? Are there cameras?
+ Scanning - Is door/window locked?
+ Gaining access - Get in via a window.
+ Maintaining access - Leave the back door ajar
+ Clean up - Wipe your fingerprints off the window

## Preconditions
Of course, free rein is seldom legal (let alone allowed).

Penetration testers work with a set of conditions. 
Those who work for free prefer ask for them (or permission) since "It's a prank bro" is a rather weak defence in court.

+ Scope - What one can attack without the threat of a lawsuit
+ Disclosure policy - About keeping your mouth shut after finding a vulnerability.
