# SOAR

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is a type of security software that helps organizations automate and streamline their security operations. It typically includes a set of tools for automating and coordinating various security tasks, such as incident response, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management, as well as a central platform for managing and analyzing security data.

The main goal of SOAR is to help organizations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their security operations by automating repetitive tasks, standardizing processes, and providing a centralized view of security data and events. SOAR is often used in conjunction with other types of security software, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System), to provide a more comprehensive view of an organization's security posture.
