# SOC

A SOC (Security Operations Center) is a centralized team or unit within an organization that is responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats and incidents.

The main goal of a SOC is to protect an organization's assets, such as its data, networks, and systems, from cyber attacks and other types of security threats. To achieve this goal, the SOC typically uses a variety of tools and technologies, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems), and firewalls, to collect and analyze security-related data and to identify and respond to security threats and incidents. In addition to these technical responsibilities, the SOC is also typically responsible for developing and maintaining security policies, procedures, and standards, as well as for educating and training employees on security best practices.
