# XDR

XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) is a type of security software that aims to provide a more comprehensive view of an organization's security posture by collecting and analyzing data from a wide range of sources, such as endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and applications. XDR typically includes a central platform for managing and analyzing security data, as well as a set of tools for collecting and analyzing data from various sources.

The main goal of XDR is to help organizations detect and respond to security threats and incidents more effectively by providing a more comprehensive view of their security posture and by automating the response to threats. XDR is often used in conjunction with other types of security software, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response), to provide a more comprehensive view of an organization's security posture.
