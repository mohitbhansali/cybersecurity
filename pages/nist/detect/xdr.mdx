# XDRXDR (eXtended Detection and Response) security software collects and analyzes data from endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and apps to deliver a more complete security picture. XDR typically includes a central platform for organizing and evaluating security data and tools for gathering and analyzing data from diverse sources.XDR helps businesses detect and respond to security threats and incidents by offering a more complete view of their security posture and automating threat response. To get a better picture of an organization's security, XDR is commonly utilized with SIEM and SOAR.## The need for full protection, visibility and instance responseThe ability of an organization to detect and eliminate all threats is essential for effective cybersecurity. This includes the following:* Preventing threats from infiltrating IT systems.* Detecting the threats that do make their way into the environment.* Identifying whether a detected threat is part of a larger attack.* Identifying, containing, and eliminating all threats and attack components.Therefore, cybersecurity technology must detect and react threats in an instant.## The core capabilities of XDRXDR assists security teams by increasing threat visibility throughout the environment and automating investigation and response actions. An XDR platform's primary requirements are threat visibility, alert correlation, and response automation.### Broad threat visibility and protectionXDR uses a broad perspective of primary prevention and detection components to deliver the most relevant threat telemetry. Cybercriminals are increasingly using stealthy assaults to circumvent endpoint-centric solutions like Next Generation Anti-Virus (NGAV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) in enterprises with tiny security teams. Despite huge cybersecurity investments, confirmed breaches have increased.It is critical to decide which prevention and detection components should be included in the XDR platform. Priority should be given to platforms with components that cover the primary attack vectors and provide layered security protection.When researching XDR platforms, keep the following features in mind.* **NGAV/ EPP** - Next Generation AntiVirus/ Endpoint Protection Platform, for basic endpoint malware prevention and detection and endpoint control.* **EDR** - Endpoint Detection and Response, for more advanced endpoint protection, detection and response* **NTA** - Network Traffic Analytics, for malicious activity on your network* **UBA** - User Behavioral Analytics, to detect anomalous user behaviors* **SSPM & CSPM** - SaaS Security Posture Management & Cloud Security Posture Management, to reduce the risk introduced by SaaS and Cloud misconfigurationsThese solution categories' signals detect most cyber death chain attacks. Combining these components with other data yields the best value. Deception technologies can fool successful intruders into admitting their presence before causing damage, giving an XDR platform useful indications.Since most companies can't afford several prevention and detection tools, small security team XDR solutions may be a cost-effective way to layer protection. Adding native SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) and Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) capabilities to the XDR platform gives resource-constrained teams vital security tools.### Alert and Data CorrelationFinding threats that get past first line defenses as rapidly as feasible is today's actual security problem. When properly combined with data from other security solutions, something that could initially appear to be unimportant to one security solution suddenly becomes a cause for concern.### Response AutomationSecurity teams spend too long investigating alerts. After threats are confirmed, a thorough attack investigation involves access to multiple controls through multiple terminals and presentation formats. Threat remediation involves extensive planning and coordination across multiple security systems. Many point solutions overburden security teams.XDR platforms automatically mitigate damage. Investigation, root cause determination, and threat effect analysis start response steps. Some XDR programs automatically list running processes, query a Windows registry, collect environmental variables, or launch a script.## The benefits of XDRXDR integrates various control points for threat prevention, detection, and response. This method improves detection accuracy while greatly simplifying threat protection.* Accuracy* Efficiency* Cost Reduction* Simplicity
