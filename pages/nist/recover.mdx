# Recover

According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the "Recover" function refers to the processes and activities that an organization uses to restore its operations and systems after a cybersecurity event. This includes activities such as incident response and recovery planning, as well as the development of procedures for restoring critical systems and data in the event of a security incident.

The goal of the Recover function is to ensure that an organization is able to quickly and effectively restore its operations and systems after a cybersecurity event, and to minimize the impact of the event on the organization. By having a well-defined recovery plan in place, and by regularly testing and maintaining this plan, an organization can ensure that it is prepared to effectively respond to and recover from a wide range of cybersecurity events.
