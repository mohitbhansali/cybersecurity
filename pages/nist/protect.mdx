# Protect

According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the "Protect" function refers to the processes and activities that an organization uses to secure its assets, systems, networks, and users from cybersecurity threats. This includes activities such as implementing security controls, such as firewalls, access controls, and data encryption, and establishing policies, procedures, and standards to ensure the security of the organization's assets.

The goal of the Protect function is to reduce the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity event, and to ensure that the organization's assets, systems, networks, and users are adequately protected against potential threats. By implementing appropriate security controls and practices, an organization can effectively protect itself against a wide range of cybersecurity threats, including malicious attacks, data breaches, and other types of security incidents.
