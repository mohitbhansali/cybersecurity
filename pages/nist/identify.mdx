# Identify

According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the "Identify" function refers to the processes and activities that an organization uses to identify and characterize the assets, systems, networks, and users within its environment. This includes activities such as asset inventory and discovery, network mapping, and user authentication and access control.

The goal of the Identify function is to help an organization understand and manage the risks associated with its assets, systems, networks, and users, and to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect these assets. By accurately identifying and characterizing its assets, systems, networks, and users, an organization is better able to prioritize and implement appropriate security controls, and to respond to and recover from cybersecurity events.
