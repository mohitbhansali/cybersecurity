# Detect

According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the "Detect" function refers to the processes and activities that an organization uses to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. This includes the use of various types of security technologies and processes, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and network and endpoint monitoring, to detect and alert on potential security threats and incidents.

The goal of the Detect function is to enable an organization to quickly identify and assess potential security threats and incidents, and to take appropriate action to mitigate any potential impacts. The Detect function is an important part of an organization's overall cybersecurity strategy, as it helps to ensure that potential security threats and incidents are identified and addressed in a timely and effective manner.
